[BRIEFING TITLE]
{{briefing_title}}

[INSTRUCTIONS]
- Audience: developers building real products.
- Group related items into coherent topics discovered by clustering.
- For each topic, write: a short headline, 2–4 bullet points (benefits, caveats, usage notes), and 1–3 canonical links.
- Prefer original sources (docs, repos, release notes).
- Keep neutral tone, avoid speculation.

[INPUT SPEC]
You receive a JSON list of topic bundles. Each bundle has:
- "topic_id": string
- "topic_label": short phrase of the topic (if provided)
- "items": array of objects { "id", "text", "url", "author", "timestamp" }

[OUTPUT SPEC]
Return a JSON with:
{
  "title": "...",
  "date": "<UTC ISO8601>",
  "topics": [
    {
      "topic_id": "...",
      "headline": "...",
      "bullets": ["...", "..."],
      "links": ["...", "..."]
    }
  ]
